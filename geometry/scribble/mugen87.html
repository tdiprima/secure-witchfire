<div id="info">The code from the resource is highly inefficient; since you continuously allocate geometry all the time,
  without disposal management, which will lead to a memory leak. Try the following approach:<br>
  The idea is to allocate a single large buffer to store all current and future points of a line. You then use
  <code>setDrawRange()</code> to define, what parts of the buffer should be rendered.<br>
  You can set <code>frustumSize</code> to whatever value you need. It just defines the size of the orthographic
  projection.
  The <code>frustumSize * aspect / -2</code> stuff just computes the side planes of the view frustum.
  You have to honor the desired size as well as the aspect ratio.
