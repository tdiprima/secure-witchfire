# Reflector

[webgl mirror](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_mirror.html)

This is the cool one: [reflector](https://sbcode.net/threejs/reflector/)

Mirror is really heavy.

I just wanted to see because the sky/sign guy was gonna use it.

How do I know:

```js
import { Reflector } from 'https://cdn.rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r124/examples/jsm/objects/Reflector.js';
```
